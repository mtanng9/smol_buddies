# smolBuddies

## Project Overview
smolBuddies is a front-end website I designed and developed for an online stuffed animal store. This project primarily focused on practicing React and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The website was developed with a mobile-first approach and later adapted for wider screens.

## Design and Development Process
I started the project by creating a detailed wireframe and visual mockup in Canva. Then, I translated these designs into a functional website using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. My focus was on making the website engaging, easy to use, and visually appealing for an e-commerce experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the dynamic user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

## Known Issues and Future Directions
One challenge faced during development was related to the logo and product images, which are all in PNG format. This slightly affected the styling compared to the initial rendering sketch. In the future, these aspects will be revisited to enhance styling consistency and ensure an even better user experience.

## Getting Started
To view the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd smol_buddies
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Plans
- Incorporate a backend to enable item purchasing and inventory management.
- Add a login feature to allow users to save items to their cart.
- Optimize image formats for faster loading and improved styling consistency.
- Add animations for a more interactive shopping experience.
